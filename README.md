# EulerDerivation
Derives Euler's number (e) in an optimized way using CUDA for maximum performance.

# Concept
This program computes e using the Taylor series expansion and parallel computing with CUDA, ensuring the fastest possible computation.

üí° Idea by: Adhiraj1336 (Adhiraj Mishra) ‚Äì Optimized calculation of e using GPU acceleration.

# ‚öô Prerequisites
1Ô∏è‚É£ NVIDIA RTX GPU Required

The program utilizes CUDA, which requires an NVIDIA RTX series GPU for acceleration.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Disable IntelliSense Warnings

Some IDEs (like VS Code) may show errors due to IntelliSense misinterpreting CUDA-specific syntax. You can safely ignore or disable these warnings.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-Compiled for Easy Execution

No need to compile‚Äîjust run the executable (main.exe) directly.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Windows-Only Compatibility

This program is designed for Windows and may not work on other operating systems.
